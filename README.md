This is an attempt at implementing a genetic learning algorithm in
golang, inspired by [Code
Bullet](https://github.com/Code-Bullet/Smart-Dots-Genetic-Algorithm-Tutorial).

This code depends on the [pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel) 2D
game library for golang.


To install and run the code simply run the following commands (Assuming
go is installed, $GOPATH is correctly set and $GOPATH/bin is in $PATH)
```
go get -u github.com/sdclarke/genetic/cmd/dots
dots
```
